<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nikita Racquel Taoushiani, a 20-year-old beginner in the world of web development.
I’m just starting my journey in tech, and I’m excited to learn how to turn creative ideas into real, functional websites.
Even though I don’t have any prior experience, I believe curiosity and consistency are my greatest strengths.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved problem-solving and expressing myself creatively, and web development feels like the perfect blend of both.
 Whether it’s structuring a simple page or experimenting with design, every new thing I learn feels like a small win
 and I’m looking forward to many more.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a space where I’ll share my growth and the projects I’m working on.
I know I’m at the beginning of the road, but I’m passionate about building something meaningful
and I can’t wait to look back one day and see how far I’ve come.</p>
